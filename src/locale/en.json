Since the beta-glucan molecule itself is quite large in size, when it enters the intestine, it does not undergo fragmentary fermentation.

Due to the repopulation mechanism, activated lymphocytes from the intestinal mucosa are disseminated into the mucous membranes of various organs, thus ensuring their protection against infections.",
